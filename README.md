Fellow Social Justice Warriors,

We have here a great opportunity to elect the best man and the best woman in Brazil of 2018!
**The poll runs until 30th November.**

This voting is important to our cause because we have two very
important humans running:

- **Thammy Gretchen**, a trans-woman, running for the best man of 2018, and

- **Pabllo Vittar**, a trans-man, running for the best woman of 2018.

Help our cause, make our word reach the entire world!

The Python script contained in this repository votes for each of them automatically, every 30 seconds.

Once cloned this repository, you may run `python vote.py` directly, but one can also run inside a container for further protection:

```
$ docker build -t votemachine .
$ docker run -it votemachine
```

Once put up running, you may continue our fight in the social networks as usual.

Best Regards,

*Robert J. Smith*
